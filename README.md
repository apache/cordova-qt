Download the source code and open the project file with Qt Creator. Add your HTML and JavaScript files to the www folder. Edit xml/plugins.xml to enable or disable any required plugins. Compiling, deployment, and packaging works as described in the Qt Creator documentation.

Supported APIs
--------------

- Accelerometer
- Compass
- Connection
- Contacts
- Device
- Events
- File (Except for File Transfer API which has no direct support in Qt Mobility and is not implemented for now)
- Geolocation (Uses the W3C Geolocation API specifications)
- Notification (implemented for MeeGo Harmattan only)
- Storage (Uses the W3C WebSQL Database and Web Storage API specifications)
- Camera (Basic support on Symbian and MeeGo Harmattan but no gallery or image settings)

Unsupported APIs
